In folder Precompiled Examples, there provide some pre-compiled S-record images of example projects for use with the MSD 
Flash Programmer.

# description for each examples

1. hello world
The Hello World project is a simple demonstration program that uses the 
KSDK software.  It prints the "Hello World" message to the terminal using the KSDK UART
drivers.  The purpose of this demo is to show how to use the UART and a simple debugging, golden project.

2. low power demo
This low power demo application demonstrates different low power modes supported on the Kinetis KL03 chip, such as WAIT, STOP/PSTOP1/PSTOP2, VLPR, VLPW, VLPS, and VLLSx. 
Follow a sequence to enter/exit each mode, because the functionality available in different power modes is different. 
The application demonstrates multiple mode entry/exit cases as per the functionality availability. User can measure chip IDD current under low power mode,
please disable RTC oscillator to get accurate value. 

3.rtc demo
The RTC Demo project is a simple demonstration program based on the KSDK RTC 
peripheral driver. It uses the UART driver to show a clock-like application and 
display hours, minutes, and seconds. and blue LED blinking each 1s .

4.thermistor demo
The Thermistor demo application demonstrates Thermistor with ADC convert function.
Initally, the green LED is on to indicate that the Thermistor is working at a normal temperature. <br>
When the thermistor is heated, the green LED is off and red LED is on.
If the thermistor is not heated, the green LED is on and the red LED is off.

# Serial terminal configuration

The serial terminal is configured for these settings:

- 9600 bps
- 8 data bits
